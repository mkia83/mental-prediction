mental prediction 
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **mental health data** using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to explore patterns, correlations, and insights related to mental health factors, providing a foundation for further research and practical applications in healthcare and technology.

🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess mental health datasets.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations.  
- Visualize findings with clear and informative charts.  
- Apply machine learning models (if included) to predict or classify mental health outcomes.  
- Provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers.  

 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` (data manipulation)  
  - `numpy` (numerical operations)  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` (visualization)  
  - `scikit-learn` (machine learning, if applied)
